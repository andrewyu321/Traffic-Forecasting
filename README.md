# Traffic-Predictor
This repository contains code for a project to forecast the traffic for intersections in Toronto. The data was acquired from the City of Toroto's Open Data Catalogue. The project aims to predict traffic patterns and congestion using machine learning techniques. The intent of this project is to help better understand traffic patterns better throughout different times of the day and different months in the year.

# Predictions
I tested out SVM, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost to see which one performed the best. The results showed that Random Forest Regressor performed the best.
